The Mongo Scraper app scrapes from the Elite Daily website and populates the app with current article headlines, cover photos, the authors and an actual link to the articles. You can save an article by clicking the save button and you can access all your saved articles through a separate page. You can also delete a saved article by hitting the delete button. Lastly you can clear out all your saved articles by hitting clear.
